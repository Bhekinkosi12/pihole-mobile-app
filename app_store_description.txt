Pi ContrHOLE is an unofficial, open-source, and FREE app developed by a fan of the Pi-Hole project.

Features:
- Connect to PiHole anywhere on your local network by IP address
- See quick stats about your cumulative ads filtered, percentage filtered, etc..
- Store app session key
- Quickly toggle settings on your local instance
- Disable PiHole quickly to debug network DNS issues

You will need to enter your WEBPASSWORD found under /etc/pihole/setupVars.conf to modify any settings.  The API token for this app is NOT the one found in the web GUI, nor is it your login password. 

NOTE: You must already have a pi-hole instance running on your local network.  For more info check out the Pi-Hole project at https://pi-hole.net/.  

Testing with versions:
Pi-hole v4.4 
Web Interface v4.3.3 
FTL v4.3.1

If you have any problems, please raise an issue on Github via the "Support URL" link.
